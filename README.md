# LPOO_13 Quadrivium

A Tron-inspired game, with 4 different sub games, each with various levels of difficulty. As in the original game, the difficulty only increases once all the sub games have been beat once. The sub games are the following:
- (based on I/O Tower) the player must enter a tower within a time limit, while avoiding or destroying enemies.
- (based on MCP Cone) the player must ascend into a cone, without touching the wall in front of it (this wall can be destroyed by shooting at it).
- (based on Battle Tanks) the player drives a tank in a maze, attempting to kill all enemy tanks without dying.
- (based on Light Cycles) the player must guide a vehicle in an arena, while avoiding the trails left behind by the player and the enemy (or enemies).
